      <h1>Education</h1>
      <p>I am currently a senior at St. John's University. Coming into St. John's I was undecided on what major I would pursue.
        After taking a few classes in various disciplines I declared computer science as my major. In
      my junior year I decided I would follow the computer science path with a concentration in business administration. As a result, I
    have taken classes such as Management, Financial Management, Accounting, and Business Law. Some of the computer science courses that I
    enjoyed the most are Software Engineering, Data Mining, Database Management Systems, and Data Security & Cryptography.</p>
